## What Is Economic Stimulus? How It Works, Benefits, and Risks

Economic stimulus is action by the government to encourage private sector economic activity. To stimulate the economy, the 
government adopts targeted, expansionary policies.

Economic stimulus in the United States may be related to monetary policy carried out by the Federal Reserve. Other froms of
economic stimulus are driven by fiscal policy, with lawmakers directing tax policies and government spending toward areas
that they believe will jump-start the economy

Policy tools for implementing economic stimulus include lowering interest rates, increasing government spending, and the
purchase of assets by the central bank in a process known as quantitative easing. It is common for the government to adopt
stimulus policies during times of recession, but economic stimulus may also be used to provide an additional boost during
periods of economic strength.

Although the long-term benefits of suth policies remain a subject of debate, the programs put in place to bolster the economy
can have a big impact on financial markets and investors. This makes it important to be aware of the mechanisms of economic
stimulus as well as the associated benefits and risks.  -- TODO
